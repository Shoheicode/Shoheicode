### Hi there 👋

I am Jason Irie, a current College Student (specializing in Software Development) pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.

I enjoy working on my own personal projects and participating in Hackathons and learning about new Technologies. Recently, I learned about Flutter and Firebase and plan on implementing that technology in future projects like C++ related projects with Firebase and Flutter Websites.
