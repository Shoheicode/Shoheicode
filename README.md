### Hi there 👋

I am Jason Irie, a current College Student (specializing in Software Development) pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.

I enjoy working on my own personal projects and participating in Hackathons and learning about new Technologies. Recently, I learned about Flutter and Firebase and plan on implementing that technology in future projects like C++ related projects with Firebase and Flutter Websites. 

Best Project Examples:
- [Bank Management Project]()

C++ Projects:
- [Ice Man Project]()
- [Bank Management Project]()

Flutter Project:
- [Google Developer Student Club Solution Challenge]()

Unity Game Development:
